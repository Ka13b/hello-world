# hello-world
My name is Squimbillion Squaddletus.
I like to squeggle my squeggleball on Wednesdays.
Sometimes I play squeggleball with my friends, Qoqur, Jhonnarth, and Lintlebin.
On weekends I like to watch the squeggleball championships on Squarentintlegrah News.
I enjoy drinking faeces frappuccinos and eating Qoqur's pet named Gordyun.
